# Predicting YouTube Video Categories
***

## Summary
I worked on this project as an introduction to Machine Learning in Python. I use YouTube daily and thought this would be a good exercise in text analytics and the train/test process of predictive models. The project was done mainly using Pandas and Scikit-learn.
